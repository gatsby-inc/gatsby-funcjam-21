Need to use an application token to get info about the private repo?

- If not I will have to ask for access to their private repos and I do not want to do that.

Create an endpoing to get user info?
That I call after getting the access token, save the access token in cookie or local storage?

Should I create a machine user, inside queen-raae-land?
